## About

ReactJS + SASS(scss), this site about company which builds new rooms in your house using 5th+ dimensions, for example if your room is 20m^2, it can be expand to 40m^2 by adding new room/s (one by 20m^2 or two by 10m^2) in those dimensions, the space will be not 3D, so even if you have limited space, this technique does not care.
